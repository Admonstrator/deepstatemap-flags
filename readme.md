# DeepStateMap - Neutral Flags
Version: 0.2

## Purpose

This script was written for the (German) YouTube channel [Military & History with Torsten Heinrich](https://www.youtube.com/@MilitarGeschichte) so that it can pursue its neutral reporting.

The default setting of the DeepStateMap shows the Russian soldiers as pigs, the Belarusians as potatoes. While this may be in line with one's own view, it is a hindrance in neutral reporting.

I distance myself from any warfare and wish for nothing more than for Russia to withdraw.

Ukraine is a wonderful country with enchanting culture and interesting people.

Glory to Ukraine! Slava Ukraini!
